# COCO-CODE
A code used to detect protein crystals in images, then draw bounding boxes and masks over them.
This project involves using machine learning models to analyze images of protein crystals.
This code is named COCO code because it executes based on a COCO model.
Its main function is detecting the protein crystals in the images. It then draws bounding boxes around them and a masks over them.
It performs object detection and instance segmentation.
